### Mapping DSI Revenue Options A to D

##### Agata Makowska-Curran 

Agata Makowska-Curran from LSE broke down the different components of any revenue model, the possible ways of measuring them, and data availability, indicating components where there is high data availability for the sake of measurement and low data availability for the sake of measurement.

### Unlocking Private Capital: Navigating Regulation, Metrics and Investor Motivations

##### Saipriya Kamath 

Dr Kamath from LSE explored the investor perspective on socially responsible investing. She also explored different approaches to regulation, including legislative and non-legislative approaches. She explained that sales, turnover and revenue are the same thing, and provided an exploration of how these metrics vary between companies by size, region or sector. She emphasised the power of disclosures for changing company behaviour and raised the issue of keeping the full value chain in view when assessing contributions for DSI products. Finally she presented a toy model she developed with Agata Makowska-Curran. While acknowledging assumptions made during the development of the model, they demonstrated the amounts of funding that would need to be raised either from a top-down approach by country, or bottom up approach by company to reach various sums for the global fund.

### Definitions and Triggers: Options A to D

##### Pedro Batisa

Pedro Batista from the Max Planck Institute evaluated the pros and cons of revenue and turnover and the pros and cons of options A to D

### Capitalising the global fund: The Profit Scenario

##### Matt Bassford

Matt Bassford reported the findings of an ICF report commissioned by DEFRA. (The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). The ICF reviewed different benefit sharing mechanisms for the MLM, assessing them based on criteria in Decision 15/9. The conclusion was reached that a 1% levy on profits is the most viable option based on policy compliance and market impact.

### Profits and Sales in IPLC Negotiations

##### Kyle Vermette

Kyle Vermette recounted his experience as an Indigenous lawyer participating in negotiations between Indigenous Peoples and oil companies. He related that in these scenarios sales is the preferred metric, due to potential delays in or absence of profits. He also emphasised the importance of nature being paid first, and that this approach is based on recognition and respect

### Fair and Equitable Matrix Based Sharing of Monetary Benefits Arising from the Utilization of DSI

##### Andrew Niebler

Andrew Niebler presented his approach to the DSI value chain, making the point that the value chain for DSI extends beyond a specific instance of the use of DSI in a product. He showed a visual representation of stratification of companies by pertinence of DSI to company profits before presenting a matrix-based approach to DSI contributions which took into account company size and pertinence of DSI to profits and suggested staged implementation over time.

### The Impact of Sales vs Profits for Natura

##### Ana Viana

Ana Viana from Natura Brasilia presented figures showing the impact use of different metrics was likely to have on Natura. She made the point that Natura was already actively engaged in benefit sharing under the Nagoya Protocol and that without care, the requirement to share benefits under the mechanism may hamper a company's ability to enter into bilateral agreements under Nagoya.

### The 1% of Retail Proposal

##### Pierre du Plessis 

Pierre du Plessis presented the African Union's proposal that contributions to the global fund should be collected from a 1% levy of retail sales of all bio-based products paid at the till. Pierre clearly conveyed the urgency of the current climate crisis and the need for bold solutions.

### Is a Duck a Fish? What UN Economic Classification Systems Can do for DSI

##### Paul Oldham
Paul Oldham from One World Analytics explored the relationships between different UN and non-UN classification systems, including ISIC codes used to classify companies, HS codes used to classify products for international trade, and CPC codes used to classify products and services sold internally. Paul used these codes to show how biodiversity based companies and products can be identified. However he explained that identifying whether such products were DSI reliant would be extremely challenging.

### The Value of DSI and DSI Data Sets

##### Sarah Taylor

Sarah Taylor from the Water Research Centre explored methods of valuing DSI using natural capital accounting, exploring when and how data accrues value and different approaches to analysing the costs and values associated with data.

### A Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism

##### Stephanie Switzer

Jasmine Kindness presented a proposal by Stephanie Switzer on a "Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism" whereby funds could be collected for the mechanism by adjusting the tariffs on internationally traded products. She explained that "tariff water" is the difference between a bound rate and an applied tariff rate.
