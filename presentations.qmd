### Baseline for Roundtable & Reflections on Draft Recommendation of the WG

##### Siva Thambisetty (begins: 11:45)

Siva Thambisetty from the LSE set the scene for the roundtable by reframing questions arising from the working group on DSI in Montreal. She highlighted the absence of considerations of the value of data as an asset from the discussions so far, suggested the potential use of data trusts to increase trust in data sharing and suggested that targets would be important to anchor future discussions around contributions to the fund. She introduced the FRETAP principles for fair contributions to the mechanism and ended on the concept of the "Goldilocks zone" emphasising the importance of balancing trade-offs and avoiding extremes at either end of the spectrum.

### Mapping DSI Revenue Options A to D

##### Agata Makowska-Curran (begins: 32:36)

Agata Makowska-Curran from the LSE provided a detailed analysis of different components of options A to D, their definitions and an overview of what data sources are available to the public or to governments to assess these components, pointing to instances of high or low data availability.

### Unlocking Private Capital: Navigating Regulation, Metrics and Investor Motivations

##### Saipriya Kamath (begins: 59:56)

Dr Kamath from the LSE explored the investor perspective on socially responsible investing and different approaches to regulation, including legislative and non-legislative approaches. She explained that sales, turnover and revenue refer to the same thing, and provided an exploration of how company size, region or sector may affect the metrics of profit or sales. She emphasised the power of disclosures in changing company behaviour and raised the issue of keeping the full value chain in view when assessing contributions for DSI products. Finally she presented a toy model developed in collaboration with Agata Makowska-Curran. While acknowledging assumptions made during the development of the model, they demonstrated the level of funding needed to reach various target sums for the global fund, either from a top-down approach by country, or bottom up approach by company.

## Block Two

### Definitions and Triggers: Options A to D

##### Pedro Batisa

Pedro Batista from the Max Planck Institute presented the outcomes of his research evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of profits and sales and the strengths and weaknesses of Options A to D.

### Capitalising the Global Fund: The Profit Scenario

##### Matt Bassford

Matt Bassford from the ICF reported on the findings of a report commissioned by DEFRA. The ICF reviewed different benefit sharing mechanisms for the MLM, assessing them based on the criteria in Decision 15/9. The conclusion was reached that a 1% levy on profits is the most viable option based on policy compliance and market impact.

### Profit vs Sales in Indigenous Land Negotiations

##### Kyle Vermette

Indigenous lawyer Kyle Vermette from the Firelight Group shared his perspective on the profits vs. sales debate, drawing from his experience in negotiations between Indigenous Peoples and oil companies. He explained that sales are the preferred metric in these discussions due to the unpredictable nature of profits in the sector. He also underscored the importance of paying nature first, framing this approach as one rooted in recognition and respect.

### Fair and Equitable Matrix Based Sharing of Monetary Benefits Arising from the Utilization of DSI

##### Andrew Niebler

Andrew Niebler from Karner Blue Capital demonstrated that the value chain for DSI extends beyond a specific instance of the use of DSI in a product. He proposed stratification of companies by importance of DSI to their profits and presented a matrix-based approach to DSI contributions which took into account company size and importance of DSI to profits. He suggested staged implementation of the mechanism over time.

A further elaboration of Andrew Niebler's Matrix based approach is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/r5eucg8cy8qohsbiyoohd/Niebler_Matrix-Based-Fair-and-Equitable-DSI-Fund.pdf?rlkey=0tkwhjxzb15y56l5l6vmm2vje&st=pgqz7o5n&dl=0){target="_blank"}

### The Impact of Sales vs Profits for Natura

##### Ana Viana

Ana Viana from Natura Brasilia used Natura's financial records to illustrate the potential impact of different metrics on the company. She emphasized that Natura is already actively engaged in benefit-sharing under the Nagoya Protocol, and cautioned that without careful management, the obligation to share benefits under the mechanism could limit a company's ability to engage in bilateral agreements under the Nagoya framework.

### The 1% of Retail Proposal

##### Pierre du Plessis

Pierre du Plessis presented the Africa Group's proposal that contributions to the global fund should be collected from a 1% levy of the retail price of all bio-based products at the point of sale. Pierre clearly conveyed the urgency of the current climate crisis and the need for bold solutions to address the biodiversity finance gap.

### Is a Duck a Fish? What UN Economic Classification Systems can do for DSI

##### Paul Oldham

Paul Oldham from One World Analytics explored the relationships between UN and non-UN classification systems, including ISIC codes used to classify companies, HS codes used to classify products for international trade, and CPC codes used to classify products and services sold internally. Paul used these codes to show how biodiversity based companies and products can be identified. However he explained that identifying whether individual products were DSI reliant would be extremely challenging.

### The Value of DSI and DSI Data Sets

##### Sarah Taylor

Sarah Taylor from the Water Research Centre explored methods which could be used to value DSI using natural capital accounting, exploring when and how data accrues value and different approaches to analysing the costs and values associated with data.

### A Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism

##### Stephanie Switzer

Jasmine Kindness from One World Analytics summarised a proposal by Stephanie Switzer from the University of Strathclyde on a "Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism" whereby funds could be collected for the mechanism by adjusting the tariffs on internationally traded products. She explained that "tariff water" is the difference between a bound rate and an applied tariff rate.
