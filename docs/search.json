COP16 in Cali, Colombia in October 2016 will make key decisions about the size of the new fund, who will contribute, and how the fund will be organised in terms of contributions and disbursements. Many challenging questions remain and Parties will need to clarify the options available to them in order to take a decision by consensus on ways forward."

This document informs the ongoing debates on Resource Mobilisation.\nLessons Learned from Other International Funding Mechanisms (Secretariat Study for DSI)\nExecutive Summary of DSI Studies (Secretariat Commissioned Studies arising from Decision 15/9, the executive summary is of the pre-peer review version of the studies). The peer reviewed version and peer review comments are not yet available.\n\nTBC\n\nStudies\nA number of studies have been prepared or commissioned by different actors to inform the discussions. This list is by no means exhaustive. Some noteworthy studies include:\n\nMorgera, Switzer and Geelhoed 2019 Study for the European Commission on ‘Possible Ways to Address Digital Sequence Information – Legal and Policy Aspects’. This provides legal analysis and also provides informed analysis around benefit sharing mechanisms. See also Switzer’s study for the Secretariat for lessons learned from funding mechanisms.\nOldham 2020 Study for the European Commission on Digital Sequence Information: Technical Aspects followed by Oldham and Kindness 2022 Sharing Digital Sequence Information. Both papers use an SES based approach to the analysis of options and ultimately focus on infrastructure based revenue generation using cloud computing pricing models.\nSholz et. al. 2020 Finding Compromise on ABS & DSI in the CBD: Requirements and Policy Ideas from A Scientific Perspective. Evaluates a variety of options and favours a UNITAID inspired micro-levy for sequencing machines and reagents.\nVogel et al 2021 Bounded openness: A robust modality of access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits. See also earlier work by economist Joseph Vogel including 1994 Genes for Sale the 2000 The Biodiversity Cartel. See also Ruiz Muller 2015 Genetic Resources as Natural Information.\nOldham, Thambisetty and Chiarrolla 2023 Digital Sequence Information in the UN High Seas Treaty: Insights from the Global Biodiversity Framework-related Decisions. Argues for multiple revenue generation options under the New High Seas Treaty including aggregate use indicators linking across to natural capital accounting. Elaborated in greater detail for G77 +China here.\nHalewood et al 2023 New benefit-sharing principles for digital sequence information (paywall). Policy Forum in Science arguing for delinking access from benefit-sharing, radical simplification, a broad base for contributions across biological data and harmonization of the approach across international instruments.\nHampton et al 2023 ‘Equity’ in the Pandemic Treaty: The False Hope of ‘Access and Benefit-Sharing’. A substantive critique of the concept of access and benefit-sharing with respect to the Pandemic Treaty.\nOldham and Thambisetty 2024 The Pandemic Access and Benefit Sharing System: Four Elements of a Trusted System. Uses company and trade classification systems to identify options for securing contributions from companies."

    "text": "Mapping DSI Revenue Options A to D\nSlides Table\nAgata Makowska-Curran from LSE Did an excellent presentation breaking down the components of the revenue model, the possible ways of measuring them, and data availability, indicating components where there is high data availability for the sake of measurement and low data availability for the sake of measurement.\n\n\nUnlocking Private Capital: Navigating Regulation, Metrics and Investor Motivations\nSlides Toy Model\nDr Kamath from LSE explored the investor perspective on socially responsible investing. She also explored different approaches to regulation, including legislative and non-legislative approaches. She explained that sales, turnover and revenue are the same thing, and provided an exploration of how these metrics vary between companies by size, region or sector. She emphasised the power of disclosures for changing company behaviour and raised the issue of keeping the full value chain in view when assessing contributions for DSI products. Finally she presented a toy model she developed with Agata Makowska-Curran. While acknowledging assumptions made during the development of the model, they demonstrated the amounts of funding that would need to be raised either from a top-down approach by country, or bottom up approach by company to reach various sums for the global fund.\n\n\nDefinitions and Triggers: Options A to D\nSlides Handout\nPedro Batista from the Max Planck Institute evaluated the pros and cons of revenue and turnover and the pros and cons of options A to D\n\n\nCapitalising the global fund: The Profit Scenario\nSlides\nMatt Bassford reported the findings of an ICF report commissioned by DEFRA. (The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). The ICF reviewed different benefit sharing mechanisms for the MLM, assessing them based on criteria in Decision 15/9. The conclusion was reached that a 1% levy on profits is the most viable option based on policy compliance and market impact.\n\n\nProfits and sales in IPLC negotiations with oil companies\nKyle Vermette recounted his experience as an Indigenous lawyer participating in negotiations between Indigenous Peoples and oil companies. He related that in these scenarios sales is the preferred metric, due to potential delays in or absence of profits. He also emphasised the importance of nature being paid first, and that this approach is based on recognition and respect (No links available)\n\n\nFair and Equitable Matrix Based Sharing of Monetary Benefits Arising from the Utilization of DSI\nSlides Handout Paper\nAndrew Niebler presented his approach to the DSI value chain, making the point that the value chain for DSI extends beyond a specific instance of the use of DSI in a product. He showed a visual representation of stratification of companies by pertinence of DSI to company profits before presenting a matrix-based approach to DSI contributions which took into account company size and pertinence of DSI to profits and suggested staged implementation over time.\n\n\nThe impact of different metrics on one Brazilian company\nSlides\nAna Viana from Natura Brasilia presented figures showing the impact use of different metrics was likely to have on Natura. She made the point that Natura was already actively engaged in benefit sharing under the Nagoya Protocol and that without care, the requirement to share benefits under the mechanism may hamper a company’s ability to enter into bilateral agreements under Nagoya."
