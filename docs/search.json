    "text": "Block Two\n\nDefinitions and Triggers: Options A to D\n\nPedro Batisa\nPedro Batista from the Max Planck Institute evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of profits and sales and the strengths and weaknesses of Options A to D\n\nSlides Handout\n\n\n\n\nCapitalising the Global Fund: The Profit Scenario\n\nMatt Bassford\nMatt Bassford from the ICF reported on the findings of a report commissioned by DEFRA. The ICF reviewed different benefit sharing mechanisms for the MLM, assessing them based on the criteria in Decision 15/9. The conclusion was reached that a 1% levy on profits is the most viable option based on policy compliance and market impact.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nProfit vs Sales in Indigenous Land Negotiations\n\nKyle Vermette\nIndigenous lawyer Kyle Vermette from the Firelight Group provided his perspective on the profits vs sales question based on his experiences participating in negotiations between Indigenous Peoples and oil companies. He related that in these scenarios sales is the preferred metric, due to the unpredictable nature of profits in this sector. He also emphasised the importance of paying nature first, and that this approach is based on recognition and respect. (No links)\n\n\n\nFair and Equitable Matrix Based Sharing of Monetary Benefits Arising from the Utilization of DSI\n\nAndrew Niebler\nAndrew Niebler from Karner Blue Capital demonstrated that the value chain for DSI extends beyond a specific instance of the use of DSI in a product. He proposed stratification of companies by importance of DSI to their profits and presented a matrix-based approach to DSI contributions which took into account company size and importance of DSI to profits. He suggested staged implementation of the mechanism over time.\n\nSlides Handout Paper\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Sales vs Profits for Natura\n\nAna Viana\nAna Viana from Natura Brasilia presented figures showing the impact use of different metrics was likely to have on her company. She made the point that Natura was already actively engaged in benefit sharing under the Nagoya Protocol and that without care, the requirement to share benefits under the mechanism may hamper a company’s ability to enter into bilateral agreements under Nagoya.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nThe 1% of Retail Proposal\n\nPierre du Plessis\nPierre du Plessis presented the African Union’s proposal that contributions to the global fund should be collected from a 1% levy of retail sales of all bio-based products paid at the point of sale. Pierre clearly conveyed the urgency of the current climate crisis and the need for bold solutions to address the biodiversity finance gap.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nIs a Duck a Fish? What UN Economic Classification Systems Can do for DSI\n\nPaul Oldham\nPaul Oldham from One World Analytics explored the relationships between different UN and non-UN classification systems, including ISIC codes used to classify companies, HS codes used to classify products for international trade, and CPC codes used to classify products and services sold internally. Paul used these codes to show how biodiversity based companies and products can be identified. However he explained that identifying whether such products were DSI reliant would be extremely challenging.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nThe Value of DSI and DSI Data Sets\n\nSarah Taylor\nSarah Taylor from the Water Research Centre explored methods which could be used to value DSI using natural capital accounting, exploring when and how data accrues value and different approaches to analysing the costs and values associated with data.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nA Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism\n\nStephanie Switzer\nJasmine Kindness from One World Analytics summarised a proposal by Stephanie Switzer from the University of Strathclyde on a “Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism” whereby funds could be collected for the mechanism by adjusting the tariffs on internationally traded products. She explained that “tariff water” is the difference between a bound rate and an applied tariff rate.\n\nSlides Paper"

    "text": "This page provides resources for the LSE Roundtable on Global Biodiversity Finance and Digital Sequence Information.\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have decided to establish a multilateral mechanism on digital sequence information including a new fund. COP16 in Cali, Colombia in October 2016 will make key decisions about the size of the new fund, who will contribute, and how the fund will be organised in terms of contributions and disbursements. Many challenging questions remain and Parties will need to clarify the options available to them in order to take a decision by consensus on ways forward."

This document informs the ongoing debates on Resource Mobilisation.\nLessons Learned from Other International Funding Mechanisms (Secretariat Study for DSI)\nExecutive Summary of DSI Studies (Secretariat Commissioned Studies arising from Decision 15/9, the executive summary is of the pre-peer review version of the studies).\n\n\nStudies\nA number of studies have been prepared or commissioned by different actors to inform the discussions. This list is by no means exhaustive. Some noteworthy studies include:\n\nMorgera, Switzer and Geelhoed 2019 Study for the European Commission on ‘Possible Ways to Address Digital Sequence Information – Legal and Policy Aspects’. This provides legal analysis and also provides informed analysis around benefit sharing mechanisms. See also Switzer’s study for the Secretariat for lessons learned from funding mechanisms.\nOldham 2020 Study for the European Commission on Digital Sequence Information: Technical Aspects followed by Oldham and Kindness 2022 Sharing Digital Sequence Information. Both papers use an SES based approach to the analysis of options and ultimately focus on infrastructure based revenue generation using cloud computing pricing models.\nSholz et. al. 2020 Finding Compromise on ABS & DSI in the CBD: Requirements and Policy Ideas from A Scientific Perspective. Evaluates a variety of options and favours a UNITAID inspired micro-levy for sequencing machines and reagents.\nVogel et al 2021 Bounded openness: A robust modality of access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits. See also earlier work by economist Joseph Vogel including 1994 Genes for Sale the 2000 The Biodiversity Cartel.

Argues for multiple revenue generation options under the New High Seas Treaty including aggregate use indicators linking across to natural capital accounting. Elaborated in greater detail for G77 +China here.\nHalewood et al 2023 New benefit-sharing principles for digital sequence information (paywall). Policy Forum in Science arguing for delinking access from benefit-sharing, radical simplification, a broad base for contributions across biological data and harmonization of the approach across international instruments.\nHampton et al 2023 ‘Equity’ in the Pandemic Treaty: The False Hope of ‘Access and Benefit-Sharing’. A substantive critique of the concept of access and benefit-sharing with respect to the Pandemic Treaty.\nOldham and Thambisetty 2024 The Pandemic Access and Benefit Sharing System: Four Elements of a Trusted System.
