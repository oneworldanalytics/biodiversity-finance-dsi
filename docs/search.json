    "text": "Block Two - Recording\n\nDefinitions and Triggers: Options A to D\n\nPedro Batisa (begins: 01:59)\nPedro Batista from the Max Planck Institute presented the outcomes of his research evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of profits and sales and the strengths and weaknesses of Options A to D.\n\nSlides Handout\n\n\n\n\nCapitalising the Global Fund: The Profit Scenario\n\nMatt Bassford (begins: 20:18)\nMatt Bassford from the ICF reported on the findings of a report commissioned by DEFRA. The ICF reviewed different benefit sharing mechanisms for the MLM, assessing them based on the criteria in Decision 15/9. The conclusion was reached that a 1% levy on profits is the most viable option based on policy compliance and market impact.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nProfit vs Sales in Indigenous Land Negotiations\n\nKyle Vermette (begins 33:00)\nIndigenous lawyer Kyle Vermette from the Firelight Group shared his perspective on the profits vs. sales debate, drawing from his experience in negotiations between Indigenous Peoples and oil companies. He explained that sales are the preferred metric in these discussions due to the unpredictable nature of profits in the sector. He also underscored the importance of paying nature first, framing this approach as one rooted in recognition and respect.\n(No links available)\n\n\n\nFair and Equitable Matrix Based Sharing of Monetary Benefits Arising from the Utilization of DSI\n\nAndrew Niebler (begins 41:04)\nAndrew Niebler from Karner Blue Capital demonstrated that the value chain for DSI extends beyond a specific instance of the use of DSI in a product. He proposed stratification of companies by importance of DSI to their profits and presented a matrix-based approach to DSI contributions which took into account company size and importance of DSI to profits. He suggested staged implementation of the mechanism over time.\nA further elaboration of Andrew Niebler’s Matrix based approach is available here\n\nSlides Handout\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Sales vs Profits for Natura\n\nAna Viana (begins: 52:02)\nAna Viana from Natura Brasilia used Natura’s financial records to illustrate the potential impact of different metrics on the company. She emphasized that Natura is already actively engaged in benefit-sharing under the Nagoya Protocol, and cautioned that without careful management, the obligation to share benefits under the mechanism could limit a company’s ability to engage in bilateral agreements under the Nagoya framework.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nThe 1% of Retail Proposal\n\nPierre du Plessis (begins: 1:02:14)\nPierre du Plessis presented the Africa Group’s proposal that contributions to the global fund should be collected from a 1% levy of the retail price of all bio-based products at the point of sale. Pierre clearly conveyed the urgency of the current climate crisis and the need for bold solutions to address the biodiversity finance gap.\n\nSlides"

What UN Economic Classification Systems can do for DSI\n\nPaul Oldham\nPaul Oldham from One World Analytics explored the relationships between UN and non-UN classification systems, including ISIC codes used to classify companies, HS codes used to classify products for international trade, and CPC codes used to classify products and services sold internally. Paul used these codes to demonstrate how biodiversity based companies and products can be identified. However he explained that identifying whether individual products were DSI reliant, or determining the level of DSI reliance would be extremely challenging.\n\nSlides"

She explained that “tariff water” is the difference between a bound rate and an applied tariff rate.\nA further elaboration on the Tariff Water Revenue Mechanism by Stephanie Switzer is available here\n\nSlides\n\nThe LSE Roundtable on Global Biodiversity Finance and Digital Sequence Information was organised by the Ocean Biodiversity Collective and One World Analytics and facilitated by the Meridian Institute the Grantham Research Institute."

He made the point that universities are frequent patent applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiva Thambisetty from the LSE reflected on the implications and lessons learned from the BBNJ Treaty for DSI in the context of the CBD. She highlighted the obligations related to Party reporting under the legally binding Treaty, emphasizing the requirement to report the origin of genetic material from which the DSI is sourced, using a Batch Identifier. Additionally, she discussed the obligation for databases holding data within the scope of the BBNJ to report on that data at an aggregate-level every two years. She concluded that the direction of travel is towards the use of identifiers and the mapping of aggregate data flows, and that this shift is necessary to foster trust. She further emphasized that databases should play a key role in the architecture of trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvaro Toledo from the Plant Treaty Secretariat discussed the subscription model under the Plant Treaty, their use of SMTAs, and the importance of data collection to understand the industry landscape.\n(No links available)"

    "text": "Block Two - Recording\n\nGBIF’s Approach to Open Access to Data within a Framework of Trust and Transparency\n\nTim Hirsch (begins: 00:45)\nTim Hirsch provided an overview of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility as an organization, illustrating how its data is used globally. He explained GBIF’s use of Creative Commons licenses for their data and highlighted their user agreement, which clarifies that while GBIF data is free of cost to users, it is not free of responsibilities. He also discussed GBIF’s practice of assigning DOIs to datasets, and to each requested download, which enhances transparency in data usage and enables monitoring of the impact of GBIF data in research and policymaking, while ensuring proper recognition for data providers.\n\nSlides GBIF Terms of Use Citation Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nThe INSDC: 40 Years of Trust\n\nMasanori Arita (begins: 14:29)\nMasanori Arita from the DDBJ addressed common questions regarding the INSDC collaboration, including their use of metadata and their efforts to integrate the FAIR and CARE (without the A) principles. He also expressed concerns about DDBJ’s capacity to work with commercial cloud services and the feasibility of the INSDC registering users or charging for access to the database.\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Biodata Infrastructure\n\nChuck Cook (begins: 26:01)\nChuck Cook from the Global Biodata Coalition emphasized that sequence data gains value through comparison with other sequences and as it moves through the biodata resource infrastructure. This infrastructure is an interdependent network of databases and repositories holding various types of biodiversity data, extending beyond genetic sequences to include structures, compounds, interactions, and pathways. He also highlighted the insufficiency of funding to support the current infrastructure and stressed the importance of the free flow of information for the advancement of global science.\n\nSlides\n\nThe LSE Roundtable on Global Biodiversity Finance and Digital Sequence Information was organised by the Ocean Biodiversity Collective and One World Analytics and facilitated by the Meridian Institute the Grantham Research Institute."

    "text": "This page provides resources for the LSE Roundtable on Global Biodiversity Finance and Digital Sequence Information.\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have decided to establish a multilateral mechanism on digital sequence information including a new fund. COP16 in Cali, Colombia in October 2016 will make key decisions about the size of the new fund, who will contribute, and how the fund will be organised in terms of contributions and disbursements. Many challenging questions remain and Parties will need to clarify the options available to them in order to take a decision by consensus on ways forward."
